description: Review local changes as if they were a pull request — shows the full review in the conversation without posting to GitHub. Use this skill whenever the user wants a PR review shown locally. Trigger on phrases like "pr 리뷰해줘", "리뷰해줘", "pr review", "review this", "리뷰해", "내 코드 리뷰해줘", "변경사항 리뷰", "코드 리뷰", "review my changes", "review the diff", "check my pr", "look at my pr", "pr 확인해줘", "pr 봐줘", "pr 점검해줘". Use this skill (not git-pr-review-comments) when the user does NOT mention posting or leaving comments on GitHub.

Review the current PR (or local diff) and present the full analysis in the conversation.

## Steps

1. **Get the diff** — try in order, use the first that succeeds:

   a. If a PR is associated with the current branch:
   ```bash
   gh pr diff --color=never 2>/dev/null
   ```

   b. If no PR exists, find the merge base and diff from there:
   ```bash
   BASE=$(git merge-base HEAD origin/main 2>/dev/null \
     || git merge-base HEAD origin/master 2>/dev/null \
     || git rev-parse HEAD~1)
   git diff "$BASE"...HEAD
   ```

   c. If `origin/main` and `origin/master` both don't exist, use the last commit:
   ```bash
   git diff HEAD~1 HEAD
   ```

2. **Get PR context** (if a PR exists):
   ```bash
   gh pr view --json title,body,baseRefName,headRefName 2>/dev/null
   ```

3. **Analyze** the diff against the review criteria below.
   - If the diff is very large (>500 lines), focus on the highest-risk areas: new files, deleted validations, changed auth/security logic, and altered interfaces. Don't attempt to exhaustively review every line — prioritize signal over coverage.

4. **Output** the full review using the markdown template below — nothing else before or after.

## Review criteria

Evaluate each changed file for:
- **Correctness** — logic errors, off-by-ones, wrong conditions, missing null checks
- **Security** — injection risks, exposed secrets, insecure defaults, OWASP top 10
- **Performance** — unnecessary loops, N+1 queries, blocking calls, large allocations
- **Maintainability** — naming clarity, code duplication, overly complex logic
- **Test coverage** — missing tests for new logic, untested edge cases
- **Style** — consistency with the surrounding codebase, dead code

Severity definitions:
- **Critical** — must fix before merge; correctness, security, or data-loss risk
- **Major** — should fix before merge; significant impact on quality or behavior
- **Minor** — nice to fix; style, naming, small improvements

## Output template

Use this exact structure every time. Keep section headers identical — they're used for parsing.

```markdown
## PR Review

**Branch:** `<head>` → `<base>`  
**Files changed:** <N>  

---

### ✅ Well done
- <specific thing done well>

---

### 🔴 Critical
- **`<file>:<line>`** — <concise description of the problem and why it matters>

---

### 🟠 Major
- **`<file>:<line>`** — <description>

---

### 🟡 Minor
- **`<file>:<line>`** — <description>

---

### 📋 Summary
<2–3 sentence overall assessment. State the risk level to merge as-is.>
```

## Rules

- Always include at least one "Well done" item — find something real, not generic praise.
- Omit Critical/Major/Minor sections entirely if there are no findings in that category — don't include empty sections.
- Cite exact file and line numbers whenever possible. Never say "somewhere in the code".
- Do not repeat the diff back. Just the findings.
- If the diff is empty, say so and stop.
- Write in the same language the user used to invoke the skill (Korean → Korean review, English → English review).
